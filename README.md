### This is a day planner for someone with a busy schedule! 

<ul>
  Each list element is dynamically colored to past(grey), present(red), and future(green) so you can keep up with your next event with ease. To use the Day Planner, simply click and type your event in one of the empty feilds, then click the save button to save the event to your browser. Now even if your browser refreshes your events will still persist.
</ul>
<ul>
  The Business Day Planner has also been optimized to work with the iphone 6, up to the latest geneation of Apple devices. Because we know you aren't always going to have your laptop or PC handy!
</ul>

### Future updates:

<ul>
  Add a "clear all events" button
</ul>
